# `jsr:@david/console-static-text`

For the Rust crate, go to
[console_static_text](https://github.com/dsherret/console_static_text)

Install:

```sh
deno add jsr:@david/console-static-text
```

Library for displaying text that should stay at the bottom of the console. This
measures words to handle wrapping and has some console resizing support. Example
use might be for displaying progress bars or rendering selections.

<video alt="Video showing a bunch of progress bars outputting while the user is making selections." autoplay muted loop playsinline src="videos/example_output.mp4"></video>

## Example Use

```ts
import { staticText } from "@david/console-static-text";

using scope = staticText.createScope();

scope.setText("Some text");
scope.setText("Some very long text. ".repeat(10));

staticText.refresh(); // draw to console window

scope.logAbove("Hello!"); // this will be logged immediately above the other text
```

## Hanging indentation

Hanging indentation is possible by providing `TextItem` objects.

```ts
import { staticText } from "@david/console-static-text";

using scope = staticText.createScope();

scope.setText([{
  text: "Some non-hanging text.",
}, {
  text: "Some long text that will wrap at a certain width.",
  indent: 4,
}]);

staticText.refresh(); // draw to console window
```

This is useful when implementing something like a selection UI where you want
text to wrap with hanging indentation.

## Render interval

You can start a render interval for the duration of some work:

```ts
import { renderInterval, staticText } from "@david/console-static-text";
import { delay } from "@std/async/delay";

// defaults to 60
renderInterval.refreshMs = 30;

async function download() {
  using _renderScope = renderInterval.start(); // updates the displayed text periodically
  using scope = staticText.createScope(); // make sure this is second so it's disposed first
  for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    scope.setText(`Downloading ${i}/100...`);
    await delay(30); // do some async work
  }
}

// will show the Downloading x/100... text for the duration
// of the function call and then clear the text on exit
await download();
```

Note this won't render if there's any blocking synchronous work. To do that, you
must force a refresh via `staticText.refresh()`.

## Singleton and instances

By default, the library has two exports that are singletons around
stderrâ€”`staticText` and `renderInterval`. These are an instance of
`StaticTextContainer` and `RenderInterval` respectively. New instances of these
classes can be created and used instead of the singletons if you wish.
